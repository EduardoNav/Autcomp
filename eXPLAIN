Implementation Details
State Management: Uses @State properties text and predictiveText to manage user input and predictive text.
TextField and ZStack: A ZStack overlays the Text component with the TextField, providing real-time text suggestions.
Predictive Text Logic: The onChange modifier updates predictiveText based on the user's input by filtering the cities array. The onSubmit modifier completes the text input with the predictive text.
Conclusion
This implementation enhances user experience by providing real-time text suggestions based on input. It uses state properties and SwiftUI's ZStack to create an intuitive and visually coherent predictive text feature.
